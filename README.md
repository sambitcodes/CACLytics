## Features of CACLytics

### 1. Playground Page
- View and explore the dataset.
- Get feature descriptions and data type (categorical/numerical).
- Perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

### 2. EDA Page
- Provides **24 predefined explorations** to help understand the dataset better.

### 3. Preprocessing Page
A **7-step preprocessing pipeline** for data cleaning and transformation:

#### 3.1 Basic Preprocessing
- Removes redundant column: **`avg_cars_at_home(approx).1`**.
- Removes dollar signs from **`avg. yearly_income`** column.

#### 3.2 Feature Construction
- Creates a new feature **`profile_strength`** using weighted sum of:
  - `education` (0.1)
  - `houseowner` (0.15)
  - `member_card` (0.2)
  - `income` (0.3)
  - `occupation` (0.1)
  - `avg_cars_at_home(approx)` (0.15)

#### 3.3 Encoding Ordinal Variables
- Encodes ordinal columns while preserving the order.

#### 3.4 Encoding Nominal Variables
- Uses **Binary Encoding** for high-cardinality categorical columns to avoid excessive dataset size.

#### 3.5 Handling Outliers
- Handles outliers in:
  - **`store_sales (in millions)`**
  - **`store_cost (in millions)`**
- Uses **quantile capping** to treat extreme values.

#### 3.6 Feature Selection
- Optional but helps:
  - Determine feature importance.
  - Check correlation between features.

#### 3.7 Data Scaling
- Uses **MinMax Scaler** to normalize values, ensuring compatibility with distance-based algorithms.

### 4. Prediction Page
- Users provide input for various features.
- Predicts **cost of acquiring a customer** using media campaigns.
